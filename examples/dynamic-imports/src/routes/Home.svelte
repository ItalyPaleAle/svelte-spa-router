<h2>Home component</h2>

<p>
    This sample shows how to dynamically import components. These are modules imported on-demand with the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import"><code>import()</code> method</a>.<br/>
    Bundlers like Vite, Rollup and Webpack support automatic code splitting when you use dynamic imports, so after compiling this sample, in the <code>dist/</code> folder you'll see a bunch of different JavaScript files. At runtime, the browser requests them only when you first navigate to the route (and then they're cached).

<p>This is the Home component, which contains markup only.</p>

<p><em>Hint:</em> Try navigating with the links below, then use your browser's back and forward buttons.</p>
